# Twitter_Hate_Speech_Detection
Detecting Hate speech from Twitter Data using ML and NLP techniques


In this Project we have taken the Dataset from Kaggle which almost have 56K lines.

Performed Data preprocessing steps such as: 
  Lemmitization 
  Tokenization 
  Removing Symbols and Special Charatcters using "regex" modulr 
  Removes duplicates from the data Converted all the letters into lowercase

Then Transformed the data using Data Vectorization after that used a Machine learning model to predict the data and got 90.53% accuracy score.

Later visualized the calcuated the metrics of the model.
